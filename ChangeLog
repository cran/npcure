Changes in version 0.1-5

	2020/02/28 Ignacio López-de-Ullibarri <ignacio.lopezdeullibarri@udc.es>

	* scr: in 'berancore', 'latencynp0core', 'latencynp0', 'probcurenp0core' and 'probcurenp0' very small values of 'temp' are set to 0; in 'latencynp0core' and 'latencynp0' the equality comparison 'temp == 1.0' is substituted with '1.0 - temp < 1e-10'; these changes are to avoid the following problem detected by a referee, which we have been unable to reproduce in Linux and Windows: 0's are printed as very small negative numbers (the differences being smaller than any reasonable tolerance); also, in 'latencynp0core', 'latencynp0' and 'berancore', when assigning values to double variables, '1's have been substituted by '1.0' (for consistency, since it must not have any consequences).

Changes in version 0.1-4

	2019/06/15 Ignacio López-de-Ullibarri <ignacio.lopezdeullibarri@udc.es>

	* scr: in 'berannp0confband', 'latencynp0confband' 'latencynp0hboot', 'probcurenp0confband', 'probcurenp0hboot', some 'PROTECT's added surrounding calls to 'Rf_lang2()' within calls to 'R_orderVector(). This fix a bug detected by rchk.

Changes in version 0.1-3 (first version on CRAN: version 0.1-2, 2019/05/08)

	2019/06/13 Ignacio López-de-Ullibarri <ignacio.lopezdeullibarri@udc.es>

	* R: in all the functions detailing the namespace when calling functions defined by the package, the namespace has been removed.

	* man: as a consequence of the changes of the previous item, the namespace is removed when it appeared in the usage section of some functions; also, in 'beran.Rd', 'berancv.Rd', 'latency.Rd' and 'latencyhboot.Rd', all the calls to 'plot()' and 'lines()' in the examples section with the argument 'type = "S"' are changed to 'type = "s".

	* R/print.R: in 'print.npcure()', new arguments 'head' and 'n' (this one, incorporated to '...').

	* man/print.npcure.Rd: updated, including the examples.

	* man: in the plots of the examples, the lines are distinguished by color (col) instead of by line width (lwd); also, some legends have been rewritten. 

	* man/probcure.Rd: in 'probcure.Rd', in the examples section: where 'q3' is created, 'hb$s' changed to 'hb$smooth' and 'bootpars = controlpars(B = 1999))' is added; where 'q4' is created, 'B = 1000' changed to 'B = 1999'; in the values section, 'cross-validation' changed to 'bootstrap'; also a double axis added to the plot with the bmt data.
